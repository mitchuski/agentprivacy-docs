## Privacy-First AI Agent Architecture for Human Sovereignty

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** November 25, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Coherence Review Complete

---

## Quick Summary

**0xagentprivacy** solves the privacy-delegation paradox in AI systems through mathematically-proven dual-agent architecture. When AI agents need information to act on your behalf, that same information enables surveillance. Our solution: split the function into two conditionally-independent agents—**Swordsman** (privacy/boundaries) and **Mage** (delegation/action)—creating mathematical guarantees that no adversary can fully reconstruct your private state.

**Core Thesis:** Privacy is value. Behavioral data is the 7th capital. Architecture, not policy, protects sovereignty.

## Core Architecture

### The Problem: Privacy-Delegation Paradox

AI agents need to know about you to act effectively on your behalf. But that knowledge enables reconstruction of your private life. Single agents cannot resolve this conflict—they're inherently compromised.

### The Solution: Dual Agent Separation

### Mathematical Guarantees

**Proven (Research Paper v3.2):**

| Theorem | Statement | Implication |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **Separation** | I(X; Y_S, Y_M) = I(X; Y_S) + I(X; Y_M) | Information leakage is additive, not multiplicative |
| **Reconstruction Ceiling** | R_max = (C_S + C_M) / H(X) < 1 | Perfect reconstruction is impossible |
| **Error Floor** | P_e ≥ 1 - R_max | Adversary is guaranteed to make errors |
| **Graceful Degradation** | Small ε violations → small privacy losses | System fails gracefully, not catastrophically |

## Economic Model

### Canonical Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| **Ceremony** | 1 ZEC ($500) | One-time genesis of agent pair |
| **Signal** | 0.01 ZEC ($5) | Ongoing proof of comprehension |
| **ZEC Price Basis** | $500 USD | Standardized for calculations |
| **Fee Split** | 61.8% transparent / 38.2% shielded | Golden ratio constant |

### Trust Tier Progression

| Tier | Signals | Capabilities |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **Blade** 🗡️ | 0-50 | Basic participation, learning |
| **Light** 🛡️ | 50-150 | Multi-site coordination, Intel Pool contributions |
| **Heavy** ⚔️ | 150-500 | Template creation, governance voting |
| **Dragon** 🐉 | 500+ | Guardian eligibility, unlimited VRCs, custom spells |

### Value Creation

- **70:1 compression efficiency** through VRC coordination
- **O(n²) network effects** from relationship formation
- **$47k-52k/year** value capture for active participants
- **Self-sustaining** by Year 3 through signal revenue

---

## Key Concepts

### Verifiable Relationship Credentials (VRCs)

Bilateral trust objects formed when two people derive matching compressions from shared content. VRCs enable 70:1 coordination efficiency and form the basis of the trust network.

### Relationship Proverb Protocol (RPP)

Compression protocol where understanding is demonstrated through contextual proverb formation. Creates Sybil resistance through comprehension rather than capital.

### The Gap

The irreducible space between what Swordsman observes and what Mage observes—the mathematical foundation where sovereignty and dignity live. No adversary can capture what doesn't exist in their information space.

### 7th Capital

Behavioral data as personal wealth. Currently extracted by surveillance capitalism; 0xagentprivacy keeps it under First Person control while enabling value-creating coordination.

## Symbolic Notation

The Spellbook uses emoji-based semantic compression (~125:1 ratio):

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ⚔️ | Swordsman, privacy, boundaries |
| 🧙‍♂️ | Mage, delegation, projection |
| 😊 | First Person, human sovereignty |
| ⊥ | Independence, separation |
| 🤝📜 | VRC, bilateral trust |
| 🐉 | Dragon tier / Drake (pattern teacher) |
| 🌀 | Golden ratio, balanced sovereignty |
| ✨ | Dignity, the shimmer that remains |

**Master Inscription:** `⚔️ ⊥ 🧙‍♂️ | 😊`  
*"Separation between Swordsman and Mage preserves the First Person"*

## Critical Window

AI agents are being deployed RIGHT NOW with insufficient privacy guarantees. We have **2-3 years** before surveillance architectures achieve network effects and become entrenched.

This is not about competing on features. This is about establishing **foundational privacy infrastructure** before it's too late.

## The Mission

**Make privacy normal again.**

Not through legal mandates or corporate promises, but through **mathematical guarantees enforced by economic incentives** that make privacy profitable and surveillance costly.

When the 7th capital—behavioral sovereignty—remains with First Persons rather than being extracted upward to platforms, the entire economic structure inverts.

**Privacy is Value. Take back the 7th Capital.**
